* Overview and Motivation
- The project consists of an analysis of an original corpus of text: talk about the book 
1) author, who she is ? her motivation for writing it?
2) when was it published ? 
3) where was it published in how many languages to how many exemplaires ?
4) what were the critics ? 
5) why analyze this book ? 

* Related Work
Look for any text mining analysis of books of same categories

* Research questions

* identify your own source of text data and perform any necessary scraping or
parsing tasks to construct the dataset

* your analysis must be
comprehensive and not leave major aspects of your dataset unaddressed. The project must include
(all points):
- Original data gathering (like scraping, etc.)
- Cleaning and exploratory data analysis (like stemming, lemmatization, etc.)
- Unsupervised analysis (like topic analysis, etc.)
- Supervised learning (like text classification)
